# Calculator

This uses a mutually recursive descent parser to create a parse tree of the inputted math statement. Then it goes down the tree evaluating from the bottom up. It accepts real number inputs, pi, and e with with divison, multiplication, addition, subtraction, and exponents. It also accepts sin, cos, and tan. You can input matricies using python syntax for an array of arrays. The matricies support matrix multiplication, addition, scalar multiplication, determinant, transpose, and trace. 

The file interface.py is what should be run when trying to use the calculator. The file calculatorTest.py runs a series of tests on various operations and reports back any issues.
